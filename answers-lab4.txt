1. because mpentry.S is loaded by the bootloader as a part of the kernel but it has to be loaded by bootstrap CPU to 0x7000. MPBOOTPHYS is used to calculate the absolute address

2. when an interupt occurs the hardware automatically pushes tf_err, tf_eip, tf_cs, tf_padding3 and tf_eflags before checking the lock . this is why we need seperate kernel stacks

3. because the kernel part of all environments are identical

4. in trap.c , curenv->env_tf= *tf
